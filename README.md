This script uses starttls() method to initiate a TLS connection after connecting to the SMTP server. Ensure you replace "your_email@example.com" and "your_password" with your actual email credentials.

If you still face issues, ensure that your Python environment has access to the smtplib module and that it's not being shadowed by another module with the same name in your project.
